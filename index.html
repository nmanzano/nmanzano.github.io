      <p>
        Front-end Web Developer with 10 years of experience as a Network and Computer Systems Administrator seeking a team oriented company developing in React, Vue or Angular.
        <br><br>Following my passion for technology and continued improvement, I left Apple, where I worked as a Genius, to pursue a leadership role as a technologist at SoulCycle. During my five years at SoulCycle, I aided in the expansion and development
        of the company. During this time, I interviewed, hired, and trained employees while leading collaborative teams and establishing procedures and protocols. I created positions in Los Angeles while travelling across the country to open over thirty
        locations, during which I designed infrastructure for corporate offices and studios.
        <br><br>Motivated by my passion for troubleshooting new technologies and interest in tinkering with various program interfaces, routers and servers have allowed me to
        understand the functions of a computer's infrastructure, which ignited my passion for technology and influenced me to continue my education by completing a 6-month Web Development Immersive course at Galvanize where I focused on building RESTful,
        responsive web applications using JavaScript, Angular, and Node.

        <p>The 12th man foundation was my first development job after Galvanize, as such, it provided me with real world experience and provided for me a change to become a better developer.
          <br><br> Only a month after graduation, I was hired to assist in the expansion of the 12th Man foundation site, of which was aimed at providing its alumni a way to renew their season tickets for the school’s sports teams.
          <br><br> Entering into a new codebase was a new challenge for me, which was thankfully made easier by the mentorship provided from the lead who was able to explain the project’s history and provide the necessary guidance to enable me to fix
          bugs within the code and create additional features.
          <br><br> Besides familiarizing myself with the code, I also had to familiarize myself with Semantic UI, of which I had no prior experience. For my own professional development, I would practice implementing Semantic UI to my own projects in
          order to establish the strong foundation needed to create the images you see above.

        <p> Tutti is a chat client app, designed and developed in just one week due to the collaborative work between Adrain Thomas and myself. For our culminating project at Galvanize, Adrain and I chose to learn the react native framework even though it
          is outside of the core curriculum at Galvanize, as we felt we wanted to develop the mobile application for both iOS and Android, and we knew we would benefit from the challenge of building for both platforms.
          <br>
          <br> Throughout the project, Adrain and I worked tirelessly for seven days. During this time, we reached MVP because of our ability to collaborate, encourage, and motivate each other through the roadblocks we encountered, and we learned how
          to rely on each other’s strengths, as we white boarded problems that individually we could not solve.
          <br>
          <br> For example, in order to challenge ourselves and create an application we were proud of, in addition to learning react native, we also chose to learn firebase for our database and authentication. While able to create authentication without
          any issues, the database presented its own unique challenges. Specifically, we were able to push chat messages into the database by the fifth day but had not structured it to present the chats in order of delivery. With only thirty minutes left
          until presentations, Adrain and I went on a brainstorming walk to separate ourselves from the computer screen and troubleshoot our current situation. It was during this moment, we developed the concept of adding timestamps to the messages to
          organize the data. After quickly implementing this theory, we found our application was successful.

        <p>Friends for friends created midpoint.
          <br><br> The concept was developed from the question: “Where do you want to meet up?”
          <br><br> To create a more equitable solution to this age old question, Midpoint uses various friends’ locations to detect a point of equal radial distance to all parties using Google Maps.
          <br><br> At Galvanize, during this project, my team and I encountered many firsts. It was our first group project, which helped us develop our collaboration, management, and communication skills, and it was our first time creating an extensive
          project using Angular and PostgreSql while working with Google Maps, which challenged us and developed our skills in other frameworks.
          <br><br> Working with a team proved the most vital learning point of this project. My team consisted of five people, including myself. In order to work as if in a real production environment, we decided to delegate the work. However, in order
          to grow individually, we chose to work on things we needed development in instead of working towards each of our strengths, which proved an excellent opportunity for us to learn how to communicate our needs and troubleshoot issues as a team
          through paired programming and whiteboarding.
          <br><br> While working with a team, we also learned the value of collaboration in the first few days, as we ran into creative differences forcing us to distance from each other, which only resulted in an overlapping in our code. During this
          set back, we learned the value of collaboration to reach our goal by looking to strategies that a developing team had implemented--organizing meetings, limiting who was allowed to commit to the master branch, and communication. With our ability
          to manage and collaborate from within, we were efficient enough to finish the project an entire day ahead of schedule and earned MVP; most importantly though, we learned the value of teamwork, which has become an invaluable lesson I have taken
          into my other projects.

        <p>
          Remember Meow was the first app that I built!
          <br><br> After attending Galvanize for four weeks, I developed Remember Meow in one week to demonstrate my mastery of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery.
          <br><br> Given creative freedom to design and develop anything, naturally, my two passions came to mind--cats and games. Using my prior knowledge of HTML and CSS and the curriculum learned at Galvanize, I chose to demonstrate my new skills in
          developing with JavaScript and jQuery, so I decided to have most of my code reside within the JavaScript file.
          <br><br> To accomplish this, I wrote three functions to create the tiles of the board during loading, which proved challenging. However, through the process of trial and error, I cemented my understanding of how to use functions to call another
          function.
          <br><br> Upon reflection, I recall the various struggles I encountered with the project--having the tiles flip on a timer, saving player options when choosing a card, allowing a player to win. It was these hurdles, that made me appreciate all
          the games I played. It made me wonder how many details the player omits from their experience while playing a game in comparison to the reality of the developer’s time spent on preparing all aspects of the game to function seamlessly. It was
          with this that I began to take more pride in my work, as I carried over the same appreciation to my other projects.
